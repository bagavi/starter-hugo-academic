I am a data driven analyst with *deep customer empathy* and passion for moving the needle forward to leave things better than how I found them. I throughly enjoy both engineering and product aspect of technology. I am a growth oriented person who believes that sky is the upper limit for one's achievement.

I currently work in digitizing mortage industry one step at a time at Nexsys. My current role as BI analyst has a wide range of responsibilities --  data anaylsis, making dashboards and presentations, and user testing. I also onboard new clients and work with product manager on the PI planning and user stories. 

I grew up in Bhopal (India) which is very near and dear to my heart. I love classic rock, painting, cooking and foriegn films.
